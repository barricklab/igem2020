#  T7 Data Visualization

For scripts that visualize output data from the T7 simulation 

The `compare_genomes` script generates an overlapping barplot that compares the protein production levels of all genes from two genomes of interest. Here, the simulation outputs from the wild-type genome and the 1.4-1.6 gene deletion mutant are compared.
